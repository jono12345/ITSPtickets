# Development Status & Testing Notes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: ALPHA/EXPERIMENTAL STATUS

**This project is in ALPHA stage and largely UNTESTED. Read this entire document before using.**

### Current Status

- üöß **Architecture Migration**: Recently migrated from Laravel framework to Simple Model
- üß™ **Testing Coverage**: Minimal - most features have not been thoroughly tested
- üìù **Documentation**: May describe intended functionality rather than current working state
- üêõ **Bug Expectation**: Expect bugs, broken features, and incomplete implementations
- üîÑ **Active Development**: Subject to breaking changes without notice

### What Has Been Done

‚úÖ **Infrastructure Cleanup**:
- Removed Laravel framework dependencies
- Migrated to Simple Model architecture  
- Updated documentation structure
- Created API testing framework
- Established GitHub repository structure

‚úÖ **Architecture**:
- Self-contained PHP files (`*-simple.php`)
- Direct PDO database connections
- Simplified routing system
- API key authentication system

### What Needs Testing

‚ö†Ô∏è **High Priority Testing Needed**:

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - [ ] User login/logout flow
   - [ ] Ticket creation and updates
   - [ ] Database connections and queries
   - [ ] Session management
   - [ ] Permission/role system

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - [ ] API key authentication
   - [ ] All CRUD operations
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Response formatting
   - [ ] Rate limiting

3. **Simple Model Files**:
   - [ ] `tickets-simple.php` - ticket listing
   - [ ] `ticket-simple.php` - individual ticket view
   - [ ] `create-ticket-simple.php` - ticket creation
   - [ ] `update-ticket-simple.php` - ticket updates
   - [ ] `portal-simple.php` - customer portal
   - [ ] `reports-simple.php` - reporting system

4. **Integration Features**:
   - [ ] Email webhook processing
   - [ ] Real-time notifications
   - [ ] SLA calculations
   - [ ] Working time tracking

5. **Security Features**:
   - [ ] SQL injection protection
   - [ ] XSS prevention
   - [ ] CSRF protection
   - [ ] API security
   - [ ] File access controls

### Known Issues & Limitations

üêõ **Identified Issues**:
- Database migration from Laravel may have compatibility issues
- API endpoints may have inconsistent response formats
- Simple Model file includes may have path issues
- Authentication system needs validation
- Error handling may be incomplete

üìã **Limitations**:
- No automated testing suite beyond basic API tests
- Documentation accuracy not verified against actual functionality
- Performance claims (40% faster) are theoretical, not benchmarked
- Security measures implemented but not penetration tested
- Cross-browser compatibility not verified

### Testing Priorities

**Phase 1 - Critical Path Testing**:
1. Database connection and schema validation
2. Basic user authentication (login/logout)
3. Core ticket operations (create, read, update)
4. API key generation and authentication

**Phase 2 - Feature Testing**:
1. All Simple Model file functionality
2. API endpoint comprehensive testing
3. Permission and role system validation
4. Email integration testing

**Phase 3 - Advanced Features**:
1. SLA tracking and calculations
2. Real-time notifications
3. Reporting system accuracy
4. Working time calculations

### How to Help

**For Developers**:
- [ ] Test core functionality and report bugs
- [ ] Verify documentation against actual behavior
- [ ] Add proper error handling where missing
- [ ] Improve test coverage
- [ ] Fix broken features

**For Users**:
- [ ] Report any installation issues
- [ ] Document actual vs expected behavior
- [ ] Test with real data (with proper backups!)
- [ ] Provide feedback on usability

### Safety Recommendations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before Using**:
- [ ] Set up in isolated development environment only
- [ ] Create comprehensive database backups
- [ ] Never use on production data without extensive testing
- [ ] Assume all features may be broken until proven otherwise
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not Suitable For**:
- ‚ùå Production environments
- ‚ùå Critical business operations  
- ‚ùå Systems where data loss is unacceptable
- ‚ùå Public-facing deployments without security testing

‚úÖ **Suitable For**:
- ‚úÖ Learning Simple Model architecture concepts
- ‚úÖ Development and experimentation
- ‚úÖ Contributing to open source projects
- ‚úÖ Academic or research purposes (with appropriate disclaimers)

### Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
- [ ] Steps to reproduce
- [ ] Expected vs actual behavior
- [ ] Environment details (PHP version, MySQL version, etc.)
- [ ] Error messages or logs
- [ ] Screenshots if applicable

**All bug reports are valuable** - this project needs extensive testing to reach production readiness.

### Future Roadmap

**Version 2.1.0-alpha**:
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all Simple Model files
- [ ] Bug fixes from community testing
- [ ] Improved error handling and logging
- [ ] Documentation accuracy updates

**Version 2.5.0-beta**:
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking  
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Advanced feature stability

**Version 3.0.0** (Production Ready):
- [ ] Full test suite with high coverage
- [ ] Security audit completion
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Community feedback integration
