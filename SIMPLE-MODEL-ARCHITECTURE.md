# ITSPtickets Simple Model Architecture

## Overview

The ITSPtickets system has been successfully standardized on the **Simple Model** architecture, moving away from the previous MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to a self-contained, procedural approach that prioritizes simplicity, maintainability, and performance.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Simple Model Principles

✅ **Self-Contained Files**: Each file contains all necessary logic, database connections, and HTML output  
✅ **Direct Database Access**: PDO connections are established directly in each file  
✅ **Minimal Dependencies**: No complex autoloading or framework dependencies  
✅ **Easy Debugging**: All logic is visible and traceable within single files  
✅ **Fast Performance**: No overhead from MVC abstraction layers  

### Replaced MVC Complexity

❌ **Complex Controller Classes**: Eliminated separate controller files  
❌ **Model Abstractions**: Direct SQL queries instead of ORM complexity  
❌ **Routing Complexity**: Simple file-based routing instead of complex routing systems  
❌ **Autoloader Dependencies**: Direct includes instead of class autoloading  

## File Structure

### Core Simple Model Files

```

### Redirect Files (Legacy Compatibility)

```
ITSPtickets/
├── tickets.php                 # Redirects to tickets-simple.php

└── index.php                   # Redirects to portal-simple.php
```

### Supporting Infrastructure

```

├── database/
│   └── schema.sql              # Complete ITIL-compliant database schema
├── api/
│   └── tickets.php             # Self-contained API endpoint (Simple model)
├── css/                        # Styling and UI components
├── js/                         # Client-side functionality
└── public/
    └── index.php               # Public entry point with Simple routing
```

## Implementation Details

### Database Connections
```php
// Standard connection pattern used across all Simple files
$config = require 'config/database.php';
$dsn = "mysql:host={$config['host']};dbname={$config['database']};charset=utf8mb4";
$pdo = new PDO($dsn, $config['username'], $config['password'], [
    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
    PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,
]);
```

### Authentication Pattern
```php
// Session-based authentication used consistently
session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
    header('Location: /ITSPtickets/login.php');
    exit;
}
```

### Service Integration
```php
// Services are included directly where needed
require_once 'sla-service-simple.php';
require_once 'notification-service-simple.php';
$slaService = new SlaServiceSimple($pdo);
$notificationService = new NotificationServiceSimple($pdo);
```
